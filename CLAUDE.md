# CLAUDE.md — kaeru

## Project Summary

`kaeru` is a cognitive memory layer for LLM agents — a typed property graph stored in CozoDB with a bi-temporal substrate, a curator API as the operational layer, and a two-tier (cognitive / recollection) design grounded in the hippocampus / cortex split.

The workspace targets Rust `1.95+` with edition `2024` and uses a shared dependency setup from the root `Cargo.toml`.

Workspace members:

- `kaeru-core/` — library crate: substrate, schema, primitives.
- `kaeru-mcp/` — binary crate `kaeru-mcp`: Model Context Protocol server (rmcp 1.6, streamable HTTP transport).

There is also a non-crate `skills/kaeru-skill/` directory with a portable
agent skill (SKILL.md frontmatter + body). It's source for distribution
(install instructions in its README); not built by Cargo.

## How To Work In This Repository

Before changing code, orient yourself by crate and responsibility:

1. Identify the correct workspace member first — `kaeru-core` or `kaeru-mcp`.
2. Substrate, schema, primitives, curator API logic — `kaeru-core/`.
3. MCP tool definitions and rmcp wiring — `kaeru-mcp/`. Each verb is one `#[tool]` method on `KaeruServer`, output is `Content::text(...)`.
4. Shared dependencies live in the root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.dependencies]`. Add new deps there first; pull them into a crate with `dep.workspace = true`.
5. Treat `kaeru-core` as the source of truth for shared types. Adapter crates (`kaeru-mcp`, future `kaeru-langchain`, `kaeru-rig`) consume `kaeru-core`; do not duplicate types.
6. When adding or renaming a curator-API verb, update the matching `#[tool]` in `kaeru-mcp/src/server.rs`.

## Local Runbook

- `cargo check --workspace` — quick type-check after changes that touch more than one crate.
- `cargo test --workspace` — run tests across the workspace.
- `cargo run --bin kaeru-mcp` — run the MCP server.

The substrate stores its data under a platform-specific default path resolved at compile time (see `config::default_vault_path` for the cfg-gated branches): Linux `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kaeru` (fallback `$HOME/.local/share/kaeru`), macOS `$HOME/Library/Application Support/ai.lamantin.kaeru`, Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai.lamantin.kaeru`. Override via the `KAERU_VAULT_PATH` env var (auto-routed through `KaeruConfig::from_env`).

## Module Organisation

`kaeru-core` modules already use the `mod.rs`-with-submodules layout where they grew past flat:

Triggers to refactor a flat file into a `mod.rs`-with-submodules layout:

- the single file passes ~300–400 lines, or
- more than three cohesive primitives accumulate in one file, or
- shared internal types start appearing across what was one file.

Shared cross-submodule types live in the parent `mod.rs` (or in a `base.rs` if the helper surface is wide enough to deserve its own file).

## Important Import Rule

This repository has a strict import style:

- **Prefer direct imports** for structs, enums, functions, traits, and types at the top of the file. Import each used item by name.
- **Avoid fully qualified paths inside implementation code.** `Foo::method(...)` is fine when `Foo` is imported; `crate::module::Foo::method(...)` deep inside a function body is not.
- **No glob imports** (`use foo::*`) in implementation code. The only acceptable glob is from a deliberately curated `prelude` re-export — and even then, prefer named imports unless the prelude is genuinely the right interface.
- **No half-imports** — don't import `module` and then write `module::Type::method` throughout. Import `Type` directly.
- **If names collide**, import the parent modules and disambiguate with short module aliases (e.g. `use std::io; use tokio::io as tokio_io;`).
- **Group imports logically**: standard library, third-party crates, then local modules. Blank line between groups.
- **Inline paths are acceptable only** when normal imports cannot resolve the situation (rare).

In short: keep logic readable, keep imports explicit, and do not scatter long module paths through the code body.

## Development Notes

- `cargo check --workspace` after changes that span crates.
- When a type is used by both `kaeru-core` and `kaeru-mcp` (or future adapter crates), define it in `kaeru-core` and re-export. Do not duplicate.
- Bi-temporal `Validity` is core to the design — when introducing a new stored relation in `kaeru-core`, decide explicitly whether `Validity` belongs in the PK. Most domain relations do (`node`, `edge`); junction relations do not.
- `audit_event` nodes are written automatically by every mutation primitive in `kaeru-core`. Do not bypass mutation primitives by writing to substrate directly from `kaeru-mcp`.
- The project is a **facilitator, not an enforcer**. MCP tools hint when context is missing (e.g. no active initiative); they do not block. Cognitive primitives are available tools, not mandatory protocol. Do not introduce required call sequences.

## Backend Rules

- All graph reads and writes go through `kaeru-core` primitives — never raw Cozo queries from `kaeru-mcp`.
- **No `anyhow`.** Errors are explicit: `kaeru-core` defines `Error` (thiserror enum) and `Result<T>`. Variants describe the failure mode (`Substrate`, `SchemaBootstrap`, `Invalid`, `NotFound`, `Io`, `Config`). Add new variants when a new failure mode arises; do not stuff context strings into existing ones.
- Substrate errors funnel through the `From<cozo::Error> for Error` impl in `errors.rs`. Don't `format!("{e}")` cozo errors at call sites — let `?` propagate.
- The MCP server surfaces errors directly from `kaeru-core::Result`. No re-wrapping.
- The substrate is single-process embedded — no server, no network. Adapters wrap the in-process API; they do not expose a separate persistence path.

## Out Of Scope

- Vector embeddings as the primary recall mode — Cozo HNSW is available but kept as fallback for cold queries; structural retrieval is the main mode.
- Server / network mode — `kaeru` runs in-process. gRPC server-mode is a future concern, not part of the current architecture.
- Replacing PKM tools — `kaeru` is for **agent** memory; humans interact through CLI + derived markdown export, not a competing UI layer.
